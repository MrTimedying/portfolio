  // Calculate curved path (like neural dendrite)
  const startX = avatarRect.right;
  const startY = avatarRect.top + avatarRect.height / 2;
  const endX = cardRect.left;
  const endY = cardRect.top + cardRect.height / 2;
  
  // Create Bezier curve (natural neural path)
  const pathData = `M ${startX} ${startY} Q ${startX + 100} ${startY - 50} ${endX} ${endY}`;
  
  // Animate action potential pulse
  animateActionPotential(pathData);
}
```

### **ECG Implementation Strategy**
```javascript
// Fetch GitHub activity
async function getProjectVitality(repoName) {
  const commits = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/MrTimedying/${repoName}/commits?since=${oneWeekAgo}`);
  const commitCount = commits.length;
  
  // Convert to "heart rate" (commits per week ‚Üí BPM equivalent)
  const baseRate = 60; // Resting heart rate
  const activityRate = Math.min(commitCount * 10, 100); // Cap at 160 BPM
  return baseRate + activityRate;
}

// Generate ECG waveform
function generateECGWaveform(heartRate) {
  const interval = 60000 / heartRate; // MS between beats
  return {
    pWave: { duration: 80, amplitude: 0.1 },
    qrsComplex: { duration: 100, amplitude: 1.0 },
    tWave: { duration: 120, amplitude: 0.3 },
    interval: interval
  };
}
```

### **ECG Visual Design**
